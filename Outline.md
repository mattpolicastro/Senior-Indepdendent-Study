# Abstract
The smartphone is a relatively sudden and recent phenomenon. Through the evolution of the Blackberry, and since the introduction the of the iPhone in 2007, consumer electronics have experienced a sea change. Where the personal computer was once a series of black or beige boxes atop the desk, eminently portable and powerful computers are now in the pockets of millions around the world. The very notion of a personal computer has been radically altered.	Smartphone sales have swiftly become a business worth billions of dollars, and there is little evidence to believe this is trend is a flash in the pan. The sudden proliferation of extremely powerful computers has profound ramifications for social life. The capacity of the individual to perform tasks is greater than ever before, and smartphones function as hubs for all social interaction.
