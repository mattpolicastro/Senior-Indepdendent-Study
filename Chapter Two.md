Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" was a seminal work in feminist theory which challenged many of feminism's most sacrosanct principles. However, for the purposes of this research, it is also important to note it was a profound assault on social theories which depended on essentialism and unilateralism. More specifically, it challenged the gradual shift that had begun to take place in the computing community; instead of being seen as tools constituted of discrete parts, computers began their transformation into singular and autonomous entities of nigh-magical ability. In this chapter, I would contend that the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and other, "natural" interfaces have transformed our relationship to computers in a fundamental fashion. Where computers were once tools—extensions of the self, to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan—smartphones and other devices are popularly conceived as angry and buzzing hellions dedicated to totaling our collective time and attention.
