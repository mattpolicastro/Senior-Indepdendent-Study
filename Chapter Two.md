# Introduction
Donna Haraway's "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" was a seminal work in feminist theory which challenged many of feminism's most sacrosanct principles. However, for the purposes of this research, it is also important to note it was a profound assault on social theories which depended on essentialism and unilateralism. More specifically, it challenged the gradual shift that had begun to take place in the computing community; instead of being seen as tools constituted of discrete parts, computers began their transformation into singular and autonomous entities of nigh-magical ability. In this chapter, I would contend that the development of the graphical user interface (GUI) and other, "natural" interfaces have transformed our relationship to computers in a fundamental fashion. Where computers were once tools—extensions of the self, to paraphrase Marshall McLuhan—smartphones and other devices are popularly conceived as angry and buzzing hellions dedicated to totalising our collective time and attention. Essentialism and the oppressive deference of contemporary smartphones have resulted in a state of moral panic.
# basics
- what is an evocative object, and how does the computer fit in? (second self, chapter one)
- how did the computer reshape how we see ourselves? (part II of *The Second Self*)
# The programmable home computer
- computers were originally programmable and allowed for the creation of "micro worlds", profoundly empowering spaces in which users felt in control
- this falls in line with McLuhan's thoughts in *Understanding Media*, wherein technologies are extensions of the self
- - See "The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis"
- - we love gadgetry and technology not solely because of its utility; we love it because it is a reflection and extension of ourselves
- - McLuhan advocates self-aware and self-critical use of technology—a point we'll return to later
- however, children's toys and video games began a trend: the elimination of command line interfaces in favour of self-contained and metaphorical user interfaces ("The Condescending UI" by Paul Miller) (Jarish's disappointment and loss of control in *The Second Self* ~73)
# The cyborg self
- review of cyborg theory as presented by Haraway
- the cyborg as an assault on essentialism and the politics of identity
- - rather than clinging to dualisms and systems of understanding generated from the existing "informatics of domination", we sough to move to a new system of knowledge and understanding that is thoroughly grounded in a subjective social location rather  than objective physical reality. 
- - at this stage of the commodification of the computer, the introduction of the GUI had made computers vastly more accessible and 
- while Turkle is correct in believing that some technologist have done too far in calling for borderline human relationship s with computers, she comes from a thoroughly reactionary essentialist position
# The 7th Kingdom - Kevin Kelly and why McLuhan was right all along
- technology has become increasingly commodified in contemporary society
- Marxist interpretations begin to address this, but the larger picture is altogether more complex
- McLuhan's suggestion of self-aware and self-critical use of technology has manifested itself in two theorists: Kevin Kelly in *What technology Wants* and Sherry Turkle in *Alone Together*
- Turkle
- - Turkle believes that the use of technology has spiralled out of control; I would agree. the "holding power" of technology has spiralled out of control as a result of rampant commodification and alienation
- - she has called for "digital diets", which I think are an important step forward and a model for future use of technology
- - that said, she betrays her fundamentally essentialist stance in statements such as this [paraphrased]: "cars have been regulated substantially so as to limit the damage they cause" [cars don't cause the damage, they are merely the means of doing so[problematic argument, compare to gun control]] "technology ought to be similarly restricted"
- - in saying this, she ignores the fact that the individual plays a substantial role in this process as well—we are not helpless victims in the face of technology
- Kelly
- - Kelly sees technological development much more broadly; as the development of a seventh kingdom of life that has evolved alongside higher-order lifeforms
- - as technology has evolved, it has become more complex and specialised—as such it is predisposed to certain behaviours and needs [the "want" in "*What Technology Wants*"]
- - restriction of our technology use is important and necessary, but it does not mean that we are necessarily losing ourselves [Kelly is also something of an essentialist, but is open to the idea of cyborgification]


video games set the model for all other computing [though, arguably, children's toys set the precedent far earlier] (Second Self ~73): computers and programs became internally inaccessible (written programs became cartridges) so as to defend profits, but under the banner of being more user-friendly and accessible. this led to the GUI/"natural" revolution which transformed the computing experience from niche, empowering, and active to popular but passive [potential link to marxist alienation?]

let it be known that I am not fundamentally against the use of GUIs and other "natural" interface paradigms; they can be tremendously effective at receiving input and vastly increasing our ability to interact more efficiently with computers. that said, the movement toward those systems has traditionally beenhand-in-hand with commodification and mythologisation of technology (e.g. the cultural cachet associated with the iPhone, the first touchscreen phone and the ensuing developments in UI like Siri which goes so far as to mimic personality or sentience).
