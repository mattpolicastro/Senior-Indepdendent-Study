1. Genesis - a personal note on the origins of this project
I got my iPhone for Christmas in 2010. My years of dedication to following the latest and greatest of technological development had come to a head. For hours, I was utterly captivated by a rounded rectangle filled with lights and sounds.
	Following the bleeding edge of technology has long been a passion of mine. However, it was not until recently that I seriously applied any sort of sociological imagination to the consumer technology industry. What I have found has surprised me, unsettled me, and caused me to question all roles of technology in my life. 
2. Process - detailing the use of Github, markdown, etc.
I decided to experiment with the conventional processes of writing, editing, and publishing. This is not ground-breaking, but within the context of The College of Wooster I believe it to be unprecedented and an important step forward. The "static" mode of creation—the mythic, isolated writer toiling away—ignores the collective conversation that technology offers us. I sought to implement a more open and versatile system.
	To do so, I have hosted all of my work on Github in Markdown format (more on Markdown can be found here: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
